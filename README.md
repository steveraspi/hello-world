# hello-world
Hello fellow humans,
I have a BA in chemical engineering and I'm currently doing continuing ed in machine learning and data analytics.  I've always love to code and I'm looking forward to imporving at it.  I'm most fluent in Python, but I used Matlab quite a bit in university. 

Peace,
Fellow human called Steve
